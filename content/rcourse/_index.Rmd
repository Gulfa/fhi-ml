# Student information

SMHB, in collaboration with other departments and område, will be running weekly 1.5 hour R courses in October and November 2019.

The aim of these weekly courses is to keep the participants interested and engaged over a long period of time, which also allows them to improve their R skills on their own during this year long period.
 
The beginning 4 modules are targeted at people with zero R knowledge, and are therefore perfect for people who want to start learning R, or need a refresher.
 
If you have some basic knowledge of R then you can treat each module as an independent course. This means you are welcome to attend some modules (if they interest you) and not attend others (if they don’t interest you).

The planned modules are as follows:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(magrittr)

data <- list()
data[[1]] <- data.frame(
  date = "02/10/2019",
  time = "1120-1250",
  topic = "Basic R",
  oslo_location = "Rom S24C C 331"
)

data[[2]] <- data.frame(
  date = "09/10/2019",
  time = "1120-1250",
  topic = "Basic R",
  oslo_location = "Rom S24C C 331"
)

data[[3]] <- data.frame(
  date = "23/10/2019",
  time = "1120-1250",
  topic = "Basic R",
  oslo_location = "Rom MT6 701 Utsikten"
)

data[[4]] <- data.frame(
  date = "30/10/2019",
  time = "1120-1250",
  topic = "Basic R",
  oslo_location = "Rom S24C C 331"
)

data[[5]] <- data.frame(
  date = "06/11/2019",
  time = "1120-1250",
  topic = "Advanced R",
  oslo_location = "Rom S24C C 331"
)

data[[6]] <- data.frame(
  date = "13/11/2019",
  time = "1120-1250",
  topic = "Advanced R",
  oslo_location = "Rom S24C C 331"
)

data[[7]] <- data.frame(
  date = "20/11/2019",
  time = "1120-1250",
  topic = "Advanced R",
  oslo_location = "Rom S24C C 331"
)

data <- data.table::rbindlist(data)

tab <- huxtable::hux(
  Date = data$date,
  Time = data$time,
  Topic = data$topic,
  "Oslo location" = data$oslo_location
) %>%
  huxtable::add_colnames() %>%
  huxtable::theme_basic()

cat(huxtable::to_html(tab))
```

Thirdly, we would like to take this opportunity to tell you that if you want to participate in the R courses, you will need to bring with you a laptop that has R and RStudio installed on it. Please make sure that R and RStudio work on your laptop before you show up at the course!
